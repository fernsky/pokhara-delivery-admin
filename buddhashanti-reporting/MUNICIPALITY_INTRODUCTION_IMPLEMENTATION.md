## Usage Instructions

### Creating Sample Data

```bash
# Create all municipality introduction data
python manage.py create_municipality_introduction_sample_data

# Create specific section data
python manage.py create_physical_status_sample_data
python manage.py create_historical_background_sample_data

# Clear and recreate data
python manage.py create_municipality_introduction_sample_data --clear
```

### PDF Generation

The municipality introduction section is automatically included when generating the full PDF report through the existing PDF generation system.

## Future Extensions

The modular architecture allows easy addition of more sections:

- २.३ राजनीतिक अवस्थिति (Political Situation)
- २.४ धरातलीय अवस्था (Topographical Situation)
- २.५ प्राकृतिक सम्पदा (Natural Resources)
- २.६ साँस्कृतिक उत्कृष्टता (Cultural Excellence)
- २.७ विकासका संभावनाहरु (Development Possibilities)
- २.८ गार्हस्थ्य उत्पादन (Domestic Production)
- २.९ मानव विकास सूचकाङ्क (Human Development Index)

Each new section would follow the same pattern:

1. Add model to `models.py`
2. Create processor in `processors/`
3. Add template in `templates/municipality_introduction/`
4. Register in manager
5. Create management command for sample data

## Files Created/Modified

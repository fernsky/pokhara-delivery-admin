# Religion Processor Fix Summary

## What was fixed:

1. **Removed complex chart management system**: The religion processor was using a complex `SimpleChartProcessor` inheritance that was causing issues.

2. **Simplified chart generation**: Updated to use the standard `generate_and_save_charts()` method like the `major_skills` processor.

3. **Fixed data structure**: Ensured the processor returns data in the same format expected by templates:
   - `religion_data`: For template compatibility
   - `coherent_analysis`: For template compatibility  
   - `charts`: Standard chart paths
   - `total_population`: Total count

4. **Updated template**: Simplified the template to use the standard chart paths without complex chart management tags.

5. **Unified base processor**: Updated the base demographics processor to use consistent static file directory logic.

## Files modified:

- `apps/demographics/processors/religion.py` - Main processor fixes
- `templates/demographics/religion/religion_report_partial.html` - Template simplification
- `apps/demographics/processors/base.py` - Static directory consistency

## Test results:

✅ Religion processor generates charts correctly
✅ Template renders with proper chart paths  
✅ Data structure matches major_skills processor pattern
✅ Charts are saved to staticfiles/images/charts/
✅ PNG and SVG formats are both generated

## Before vs After:

**Before**: Complex chart management with tracking, caching, and multiple inheritance
**After**: Simple, direct chart generation like major_skills processor

The religion processor now works consistently with the same pattern as other processors!

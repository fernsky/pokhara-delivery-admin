## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

1. **PDF Generation Performance**

   - Mitigation: Async processing with Celery
   - Fallback: Simplified PDF template
   - Timeline impact: 2-4 hours

2. **Nepali Font Issues**

   - Mitigation: Multiple font fallbacks
   - Testing: Early font testing
   - Timeline impact: 1-2 hours

3. **Data Model Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with core models
   - Iterative approach: Add models gradually
   - Timeline impact: None if managed well

### Scope Risks

1. **Feature Creep**

   - Mitigation: Strict MVP focus
   - Documentation: Clear requirements
   - Decision making: Daily review

2. **UI/UX Perfectionism**
   - Mitigation: Bootstrap components
   - Focus: Functionality over aesthetics
   - Timeline: Fixed time boxes

## Quality Assurance Plan

### Testing Strategy

```python
# Testing checklist
[ ] Model validation tests
[ ] API endpoint tests
[ ] PDF generation tests
[ ] Frontend interaction tests
[ ] Performance tests
[ ] Security tests
[ ] Cross-browser tests
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Automated checks
black .                 # Code formatting
isort .                # Import sorting
flake8 .               # Linting
mypy .                 # Type checking
pytest                 # Run tests
```

### Performance Targets

```
Page Load Time: < 3 seconds
API Response: < 500ms
PDF Generation: < 30 seconds
Database Queries: < 100ms average
```
